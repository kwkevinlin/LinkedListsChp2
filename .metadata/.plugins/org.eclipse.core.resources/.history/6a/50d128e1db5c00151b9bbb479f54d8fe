 * Question: Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
 *
 * Solution: With i = [0] and j = [str.length()], check if i == j then increment i and decrement j
 * 			 If i != j for any index, then the two strings are not a permutation of the other
 *
 * Complexity: O(n) due to the single while loop
